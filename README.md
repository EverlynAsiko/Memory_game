# Memory_game

This is a front end nanodegree udacity project. 

**How it works**

When the window loads so does the game board. The timer starts when the first card is clicked as well as the moves counter._Moves are counted in form of clicks_
One can restart the game,this will set the timer and moves counter to 0 and reload a new game board.

When one matches a set of cards they disappear from the game board and when the cards are not a match they flip back.
The cards may appear inverted at times. Just match flags of the same country.
For one to get a good rating you have to be fast that is use as less time as possible and use the least amount of clicks as possible.

The game entails matching Eastern African flags so I hope you learn as well as enjoy.

**HAPPY MATCHING**
