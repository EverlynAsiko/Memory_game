# Memory_game

This is a front end udacity project. 

**How it works**

When the window loads so does the game board. The time starts when the first card is clicked as well as the moves counter._moves is counted in form of clicks_
One can restart the game this will set the timer and moves counter to 0 and reload a new board.

When one matches a set of cards the disappear from the game board and when the cards are not a match they flip back.

For one to get a good rating you have to be fast that is use as less time as possible and use the least amount of clicks as possible.

The game entails matching Eastern African flags so I hope you learn as well as enjoy.

**HAPPY MATCHING**
